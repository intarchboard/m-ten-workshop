These techniques are realized based on TCP performance enhancing proxies (PEP) that either entirely intercept a TCP connection or interfere with the transport information in the TCP header. However, despite the challenge that the new encrypted protocol will limit any such in-network interference, these techniques can also have a negative impact on the evolvability of these protocols. Therefore, instead of manipulating existing information, a new approach was presented  where additional information is send using a so-called side-car protocol independent of the main transport protocol that is used end-to-end {{WELZL}}. E.g. side car information can contain additional acknowledgements to enable in-network local retransmission faster end-to-end retransmission by reducing the signaling round trip time.\r\n```",
